Delhi has seen a huge surge in coronavirus cases in the past few weeks.


New Delhi: The Delhi government on Saturday announced new restrictions amid an alarming rise in coronavirus cases, banning most public gatherings and setting limits for attendance at restaurants, theatres, on public transport and functions like weddings and funerals.
The new rules which will stay in place till April 30, along with the earlier announced 10-pm-to-5-am night curfew, include a ban on all types of social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural and religious gatherings in Delhi.

Only 50 people will be allowed to attend weddings and not more than 20 at funerals.

Restaurants, bars and cinemas will operate at 50 per cent of their seating capacity.
